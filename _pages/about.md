<!-- ## About Me -->
Hello there! I am a Master in Robotics and CIS at the University of Pennsylvania <u><a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">GRASP Lab</a></u>, where I am fortunate to be supervised by <u><a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rahulm/">Prof. Rahul Mangharam</a></u> and <u><a href="https://haiminhu.org/">Prof. Haimin Hu</a></u> at <u><a href="https://xlab.upenn.edu/">Safe Autonomous Systems Lab</a></u>. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2024 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I worked closely with <u><a href="https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/chengenliang.html">Prof. Genliang Chen</a></u> and <u><a href="https://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng">Prof. Hesheng Wang</a></u>.

My research interests broadly include human-robot interaction & collaboration, planning & navigation, and soft robotics. I am driven by the goal of creating **safe** and **helpful** robotic systems for the benefit of *workers* and *patients*.
