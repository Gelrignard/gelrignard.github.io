    When I'm not tinkering with robots, I'm usually trying to be oneâ€”at least in terms of stability and precision <span title="Just kidding!">&#128516;</span> I have been an amateur archer since 2017, and I've been dedicated to modern competitive archery with recurve bow. It's a sport that has taught me invaluable lessons in <b>patience</b>, <b>precision</b>, and the sometimes-painful importance of <b>consistent practice</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2020, I joined the SJTU Archery Association, and was elected the <b>Chairman</b> in 2021. In a fit of ambition, I also founded the <b>SJTU Archery Team</b>, leading our band of archers into various intercollegiate competitions. My time as Chairman proved to be a period of explosive growth for the association. Under my leadership, we:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Established a <b>structured, professional training program</b> from the ground up.</li>
      <li>Fostered a vibrant and supportive community that led to our <b>membership doubling</b> in just one year.</li>
      <li>Secured a massive <b>9-fold increase in funding</b> by generating widespread interest across campus and from the student union.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While my personal best is ranking <b>12th</b> in a national championship, I'm far prouder of my teammates who brought home several medals during my term of office.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately, my time with the bow and leading the association has profoundly shaped my philosophy on both <b>leadership</b> and <b>research</b>. Archery is about constant cycle of <b>action</b>, <b>analysis</b>, and <b>incremental correction</b>. Meanwhile, guiding the team taught me that leadership isn't about target oriented refinement, but about <b>building a reasonable system</b> where everyone plays to their strengths. These valuable lessons are the foundation of my academic and professional pursuits <span title="Archery">&#127993;</span>
